# Instances that are not feasible in task C

- Instance 1 is not feasible. We would need two function calls from the main function to itself. However, the LINEAR language does not allow recursion.
- Instance 5 is not feasible since we only have one literal yet two different types - and these two conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously.
